# Cybersecurity


Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at Microsoft, tasked with enhancing the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Utilizing the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, your goal is to create a classification model that categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. The model should be robust enough to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, ultimately improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.
